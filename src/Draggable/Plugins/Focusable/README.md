## Focusable

The Focusable plugin finds all draggable elements on initialization and decorates them with `tabindex` and `aria` attributes.
The plugin will not override existing `tabindex` or `aria` attributes on draggable elements. This will make draggable elements
and containers focusable.

### API

**`new Focusable(draggable: Draggable): Focusable`**
